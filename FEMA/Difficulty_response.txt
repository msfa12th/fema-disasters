difficulties:
*finding the data - Once I found the two data sets, Fema and Zip, I had to find a third set, County Zip, to tie the two

* Null values - I had to make sure that certain columns did not have constraints when importing the data via Python.

* Data Type:  I had to make sure that Date and Time were imported correctly syntatically.  I also had to make some fields/columns had the data correctly formated

* Primary key:  Zip codes could not be unique values because a zip code can multiple citys in a county. To rectify this I
	had to add addition column to that count the rows in the .csv file by using the function =row() add the numbers. I
	then set that field as the primary

* I confirmed my data by join my tables and making sure that the total count of the original set was not exceeding in the results
